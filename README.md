# Mental-Health-Analysis

Mental health has become a key topic for the progress and development of successful companies.

According to the National Center for Health Research, 19.86% of adults in the US are experiencing a mental illness, which is equivalent to nearly 50 million Americans.

Our goal is to analyze the tech industry and help predict with strong likelihood which variables related to the organizations, contribute to employees having mental health issues which affect their performance and productivity in the work place.

We hope to provide accurate recommendations after testing different machine learning models that will allow employers to offer more on target mental health services for employees to access when needed.
